```

## 📊 How It Works

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
The system analyzes 50+ features across multiple categories:

**Recent Performance (Most Predictive)**
- Rolling HR rates (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Exit velocity and launch angle trends
- Hot/cold streak detection
- At-bats and contact quality metrics

**Season-Long Statistics**
- Home run rate and consistency
- ISO power and slugging metrics
- Plate appearance thresholds
- Quality of contact trends

**Matchup Analysis**
- Batter vs pitcher historical performance
- Pitcher ERA, WHIP, and HR/9 rates
- Platoon splits (lefty/righty)
- Recent pitcher form

**Environmental Factors**
- Park factors for all 30 MLB stadiums
- Weather impact (temperature, wind speed/direction)
- Home/away performance splits
- Time of day and seasonal effects

**Advanced Metrics (Statcast)**
- Barrel rate and sweet spot percentage
- Maximum exit velocity
- Pull rate and spray charts
- Hard hit rate trends

### Machine Learning Models

**Ensemble Architecture:**
1. **XGBoost**: Tree-based model excellent for tabular data
2. **Random Forest**: Robust ensemble with feature importance
3. **Neural Network**: Deep learning for complex pattern recognition
4. **Logistic Regression**: Linear baseline with interpretability

**Training Process:**
- SMOTE balancing for rare positive class (home runs)
- Cross-validation with temporal awareness
- Ensemble weighting based on AUC performance
- Weekly retraining with expanding data windows

### Prediction Confidence Tiers

**💎 Premium Picks (Top 3)**
- Highest model confidence
- Typically 8-15% HR probability
- Best historical accuracy

**⭐ Standard Picks (Next 4)**
- Good model confidence
- Typically 5-8% HR probability
- Solid risk/reward balance

**💰 Value Picks (Next 3)**
- Lower confidence but potential value
- Typically 4-6% HR probability
- Higher variance, potential upside
